# Surfs_Up Analysis

## Project Overview
Analyze weather data from Oahu, Hawaii to provide information that will be used to determine the viability of opening a
year-round Surf 'n' Shake Shop in Oahu.  The analysis for this project will focus on analyzing the temperatures for the 
months of June and December.

## Results:
  _June vs December Temperatures_

The large number of counts for both June and December provide confidence and high credibility of the statistical results.
 * The average temperatures for each month are the same as the 50% percentiles, which indicates the results for both months 
    are not skewed.
 * The low standard deviations indicate the data is clustered near the mean.  December's data is slightly more spread out.
 * Oahu's temperatures in June and December are fairly consistent with only 4Â° between the average temperatures. Not too
    surprising June's temperatures are slightly higher than December's.

 ## Summary:
 High level summary of the reuslts and 2 additional queries to gather more weather data for J and D.:
 1. Summary - The average math score decreased slightly.
 1. Summary - School figures remained the same, except those specifically related to Thomas High School's reading, math, and overall scores and percentages.
 1. Ranking - While Thomas High School's overall percentage decreased, it wasn't enough to change their second place ranking among the Top 5 schools.
 
 Additional Analyses:
 1. Math Scores by Grade - Thomas High School ninth grade math score is listed as "nan" (No available Number), proof that the scores were removed in the revised analysis.
 1. Reading Scores by Grade - Thomas High School ninth grade reading score is listed as "nan" (No available Number), proof that the scores were removed in the revised analysis.
